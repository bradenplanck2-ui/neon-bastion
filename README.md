​🌌 Neon Prime: Bastion
​Neon Prime: Bastion is a high-intensity, retro-arcade stationary shooter built entirely in Vanilla JavaScript.
​Players command a stationary defense turret against endless waves of geometric enemies. The game features a deep progression system with branching perks, hull evolutions, distinct ammo types, and massive boss fights, all rendered in a 60 FPS neon-soaked HTML5 Canvas environment.
